## My process

I started my solution using a couple of different sass files, one for global variables, one for card and the variables. I found that the background it's been more difficult than i expected (still struggling with that D:!)

### What I learned

This is my first try with sass, i didn't understand how to use variables and imports, but after a research i got it.
